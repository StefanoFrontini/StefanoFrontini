## A self-taught web developer based in Milan, Italy. 

My passion for programming and my desire for learning has grown enormously in recent years and this has prompted me to change my career 🏃‍♂️✨. 

This is my story 👇

I've always been interested in technology. I was really happy that day when my parents gave me the Commodore 64 as a gift. In addition to having fun with the games, I remember the emotion while writing the first few lines of code in Basic taken from a book I had ordered by mail. 

In 2016 I asked a web developer to help me create [myguitarsongs.com](https://myguitarsongs.com/). A simple change to the stylesheet of the site made without the help of the developer has rekindled my old passion for programming. 

After studying the basics of programming thanks to Zed A. Shaw's book "Learn Python The Hard Way" I started building my first projects:

- In 2017 I built [PersonalDevBot](https://personal-dev-bot.herokuapp.com/) a web application connected to a Twitter bot that allowed me to save some personal development quotes on a database and then with a simple click to publish them on Twitter. The development of this application allowed me to deepen the SQL language and the Flask web framework.

- During the 3 months of lockdown in 2020 I developed [pilloledienergia.com](https://www.pilloledienergia.com/): the website for the promotion of my activity as an energy consultant. The development of the site allowed me to deepen the Vue.js and Gridsome framework, the D3 library, GraphQL and the serverless functions.

- Finished the site of a friend of mine [partsncode](https://partscode.netlify.app/) I developed an application that allows you to create a shared shopping list that is updated in real time [Grocery List Family Edition](https://listadellaspesa.herokuapp.com/). The development of this application allowed me to deepen the backend development with MongoDB and the Socket.IO protocol.

- In 2021, I needed an app that would allow me to manage the networking events I organized and keep track of the contacts I developed. So I built [bsdating.com](https://www.bsdating.com/). The app allows members of the community to see the events they have attended and the list of participants, search by name and / or profession, make reviews and keep their profile updated. The development of this app allowed me to deepen Strapi (Headless CMS), user authentication and integration with the Mailchimp and Telegram APIs.

- In order to improve the consulting services offered to my customers, I created [Energy Dashboard](https://energy-report.netlify.app/): an app that allows me to visually analyze my customers' electricity and gas consumption in order to bring out anomalies and trends. The development of this app allowed me to delve into the React framework, the D3 library, user authentication and GraphQL.

🌱 Right now I'm studying:
- CSS
- Javascript
- Data structures and algorithms
- Canvas API
- React

🔭 I’m currently building my Portfolio Website.
