<h2 align="center">About me üòá</h2>

My passion for programming and my desire for learning has grown enormously in recent years and this has prompted me to change my career! üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú® 

I've always been interested in technology. I was really happy that day when my parents gave me the Commodore 64 as a gift. In addition to having fun with the games, I remember the emotion while writing the first few lines of code in Basic taken from a book I had ordered by mail. 

In 2016 I asked a web developer to help me create [myguitarsongs.com](https://myguitarsongs.com/). A simple change to the CSS of the site made without the help of the developer has rekindled my old passion for programming. 

After studying the basics of programming thanks to Zed A. Shaw's book "Learn Python The Hard Way" I started building my first projects:

### Personal Dev Bot

In 2017 I built [PersonalDevBot](https://github.com/StefanoFrontini/PersonalDevBot) a web application connected to a Twitter bot that allowed me to save  personal development quotes I liked on a database and then with a simple click on a button of the UI to publish them on Twitter. I built it with Python, Flask, mySQL. Building this application helped me learn about backend development: SQL queries and CRUD operations on a database, Schema, create and delete tables. I also learned the Flask web framework and how to implement user authentication.

### Pillole di Energia

During the lockdown period in 2020 I developed [pilloledienergia.com](https://www.pilloledienergia.com/): the website for the promotion of my activity as an energy consultant. 

 <p align="center">
  <img width="400" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/stefano75/image/upload/v1652341645/pillole-home-2_pn0f1z.png" />  
  </p>

The site had to have: 
- a carousel related to my latest videos on youtube

<p align="center">

  </p>
  
- an energy check-up functionality to capture potential leads, send a report to the user by email and save the email address to a database;

- charts showing the trend of the energy market and electric car registrations.

- good design.

As regards technology I wanted to try a frontend framework like Vue.js. The problem though is that single page application are not good for SEO so I decided to go for a static site generator called Gridsome. Gridsome heavely relies on GraphQL to get data from API's. I learned GraphQL queries and decided to interact with FaunaDB using GraphQL to save email addresses.

Years ago, when I worked for Repower as an employee, I was in charge of leading a team to develop a dashboard to visualize electricity and gas consumption data. We were helped by an agency specializing in data visualization. This project made me fall in love with data visualization and I discovered that the technology used was D3.js. Why not take this opportunity to learn how to use D3? So I decided to use D3 for all the charts of the website. I wanted Vue to render the DOM and use D3 only for the built-in shapes. The implementation was hard due to lack of documentation (blogs/videos) about this topic.

I decided also to deploy the site to Netlify and use Serverless functions to intereact with FaunaDB. Using Serverless functions were really nice to use! It's like having a server but without the complications of running one!

One big problem was to format nicely the email sent to users completing the energy check-up. I discovered that formatting an email with html is very difficult! So I decided to go for an email framework called MJML.

For the design of the homepage and the energy check-up I decided to hired an Art Director. I loved working with her! 
 
  
### Business Speed Dating

In 2021 I created a community to connect professionals and entrepreneus. 
<p align="center">
  <img width="400" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/stefano75/image/upload/v1652346439/bsd-9-maggio_kc8enp.jpg" />   
  </p> 

The community was growing steadily and to minimize the workflow I needed an app that would allow me to manage the networking events and keep track of the contacts I developed. So I built [bsdating.com](https://github.com/StefanoFrontini/bsp). The challenge was quite big because:

- Participants should be able to register for the event.

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/stefano75/image/upload/v1652347222/bsd-event-registration_zwymwm.png" />   
  </p> 

- Participants should be able to receive a confirmation email.
- Organizers should be able to receive an email notification when someone signs up for an event.
- The site should show the record of past events and the calendar of upcoming events
- Participants should be able to register and become members.

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/stefano75/image/upload/v1652347097/bsd-register_hncktc.png" />   
  </p> 

- Community members should be able to login.

- Community members should be able to see all the events they have attended 

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/stefano75/image/upload/v1652347584/bsd-tuoiEventi_ggs1wp.png" />   
  </p> 

- Community members should be able to download the list of participants;

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/stefano75/image/upload/v1652347724/bsd-lista_kmf5qk.png" />   
  </p> 




- Community members should be able to search other participants by name and / or profession;

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/stefano75/image/upload/v1652348236/bsd-search_gkkxii.gif" />   
  </p> 

- Community members should be able to give reviews to other members;

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/stefano75/image/upload/v1652348390/bsd-review_rbqqjl.png" />   
  </p> 


- Community members should be able to update their profile data.

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/stefano75/image/upload/v1652347419/bsd-profilo_dtkeib.png" />   
  </p> 

- When someone gives a review to another member an automatic notification should be sent to the Telegram channel.
- All participant and event data should be stored in a database.
- Organizers should be able to access the database via a graphical interface.
- Organizers should be autonomous in uploading a new event on the site.

   
The development of this app allowed me to deepen Strapi (Headless CMS), user authentication and integration with the Mailchimp and Telegram APIs.

### Energy Dashboard

In order to improve the consulting services offered to my customers, I created [Energy Dashboard](https://energy-report.netlify.app/): an app that allows me to visually analyze my customers' electricity and gas consumption in order to bring out anomalies and trends. The development of this app allowed me to delve into the React framework, the D3 library, User authentication and GraphQL.
